# Glossary

- Idiomatic: Writing code "the Kotlin way"
- Ternary: Composed of three items. An example ternary operation in C# looks like: `var result = condition ? a : b;`. In Kotlin, `if` functions the same way; `val result = if (condition) a else b`
- Multiparadigm: OOP & functional
- Vacuous truth: `all` returns true when there are no items in the array
- Expression: Has a value
- Statement: Top-level element without it's own value
- Block body: With curly braces
- Expression body: Like an expression - no curly braces
- Statically typed: Types are resolved at compile-time, not runtime, like in dynamically typed languages like JavaScript and Python
- Type inference: Inferring the type of an expression
- String interpolation: Syntax which allows for referring to expressions within a string value
- Commutativity: The ability to swap the left and right sides of an operator
- Destructuring declarations: Initialising several variables at once from a single value
- Reified type arguments: Type arguments accessible at runtime due to being inlined
- Idempotent: Will give the same output, given the same inputs
- Immutable: Cannot be mutated
- Polymorphism
